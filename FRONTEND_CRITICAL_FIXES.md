# üö® URGENT: Frontend Critical Fixes Required

## Summary
The backend subscription and boost features are **fully implemented and working**, but the frontend has critical bugs that prevent Premium users from accessing features they paid for.

---

## üî¥ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Issue #1: Likes Page Completely Broken for Premium Users
**File:** `~/www/Personal/evefound/app/likes/page.tsx`

**Problem:** Premium/Basic users CANNOT see who liked them because:
- Paywall shows for ALL users (even Premium)
- All profile photos are blurred for ALL users
- No check for subscription status before showing paywall

**Current Behavior:**
```typescript
// Lines 185-202: ALWAYS shows paywall, regardless of subscription
<Card className="bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-50 to-orange-50">
    <h3>See Who Likes You</h3>
    <p>Upgrade to Premium...</p>  // ‚Üê Shows even if already Premium!
</Card>

// Line 212: ALWAYS blurs photos
<img src={...} className="blur-md" />  // ‚Üê Always blurred!
```

**Impact:**
- Premium users paid for "See Who Liked You" but CANNOT use it
- Feature appears broken to all users
- No way to actually see received likes

**Fix:** See detailed instructions in `FRONTEND_ADJUSTMENTS_NEEDED.md` Section 1

---

### Issue #2: Tab Counters Show Zero on Page Load
**File:** `~/www/Personal/evefound/app/likes/page.tsx`

**Problem:**
```typescript
// Tab shows: "Likes Received (0)" and "Likes Sent (0)"
// Even if user has 10 likes, counters show 0 until tab is clicked
```

**Why:** Data only loads when `activeTab` changes, not on initial mount.

**Fix:** Load both tabs on mount using `Promise.all()`

---

### Issue #3: API Response Structure Mismatch
**Files:** Multiple files handling likes

**Problem:**
- Backend returns `user_id` field
- Frontend expects `id` field
- This breaks all "Like Back" and "Pass" buttons

**Backend Response:**
```json
{
  "liker": {
    "user_id": 45,  // ‚Üê Backend uses this
    "first_name": "John"
  }
}
```

**Frontend Code:**
```typescript
// This will fail - no 'id' field exists
<Button onClick={() => handleLikeBack(like.liker.id)}>
```

**Fix:** Use `like.liker.user_id` instead of `like.liker.id`

---

## üìã Quick Fix Checklist

### Likes Page (`app/likes/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Add `hasAccess` state variable
- [ ] Add `showPaywall` state variable
- [ ] Load both tabs on mount (not on tab change)
- [ ] Check `requires_upgrade` flag from API response
- [ ] Only show paywall if `showPaywall === true`
- [ ] Only blur photos if `!hasAccess`
- [ ] Change `like.liker.id` to `like.liker.user_id`
- [ ] Change `like.liked.id` to `like.liked.user_id`
- [ ] Fix `getProfilePhoto()` to handle string arrays

### Discovery/Dashboard Pages
- [ ] Add error handling for `limit_reached` responses
- [ ] Add error handling for `requires_premium` responses
- [ ] Show upgrade modals instead of generic errors

### TypeScript Interfaces
- [ ] Add `requires_premium?: boolean` to `ApiResponse<T>`
- [ ] Add `requires_upgrade?: boolean` to `ApiResponse<T>`
- [ ] Add `limit_reached?: boolean` to `ApiResponse<T>`
- [ ] Add `feature?: string` to `ApiResponse<T>`
- [ ] Add `price_id: string` to `SubscriptionItem`
- [ ] Add `next_billing: string` to `SubscriptionItem`

## üß™ How to Test After Fixes

### Test as Free User:
1. Go to `/likes` ‚Üí Should see paywall immediately
2. Try "See Who Liked You" ‚Üí Should show upgrade prompt
3. Send 11 likes ‚Üí Should hit limit on 11th

### Test as Basic User:
1. Go to `/likes` ‚Üí Should see actual profiles (NOT blurred)
2. Should see "Like Back" and "Pass" buttons working
3. Tab counters should show correct numbers immediately

### Test as Premium User:
1. Go to `/likes` ‚Üí Should see actual profiles (NOT blurred)
2. Should NOT see any paywall or upsell
3. Can use advanced filters without errors
4. Unlimited likes and super likes

## üîó Related Files

**Backend (All Working ‚úÖ):**
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/MatchController.php` - Handles likes API
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/DiscoveryController.php` - Handles like limits
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/SubscriptionController.php` - Handles subscriptions
- `app/Models/Subscription.php` - Has `isPremium()` and `isBasic()` methods

**Frontend (Needs Fixes ‚ùå):**
- `app/likes/page.tsx` - **CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED**
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Needs error handling
- `app/discover/page.tsx` - Needs premium filter checks
- `lib/api.ts` - Needs interface updates

---

## üí° Key Points

1. **Backend is 100% ready** - All subscription features work correctly
2. **Frontend has critical bugs** - Premium users cannot access paid features
3. **Quick win** - Most fixes are simple conditional rendering changes
4. **High priority** - This blocks revenue (users pay but can't use features)

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **URGENT:** Fix Likes page to unblock Premium users
2. **HIGH:** Add error handling for feature gates
3. **MEDIUM:** Update TypeScript interfaces
4. **LOW:** Create reusable modal components
